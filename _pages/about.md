Mechatronics Engineer with experience in cybersecurity, technical support and teaching. Currently I collaborate as a Junior Penetration Tester and I am focused on cybersecurity, pentesting and computer security. My enthusiasm to grow in this exciting field drives me to a constant and disciplined search for knowledge through books, courses and CTF challenges in various specialized platforms.
